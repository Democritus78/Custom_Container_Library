# Custom_Container_Library
This Container library is meant to implement items such as vector, set, etc, using the programming language C. Since C is a procedural programming language, it doesn't offer any library for containing information, as is offered by the STL in C++.

So far I have successful implemented a vector. I am working on implementing a list and linked list in C.

Eventually I will finish implementing the entire C++ container library in C.
